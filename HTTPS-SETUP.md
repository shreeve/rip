# 🔒 HTTPS Setup for Rip Labs API

## ✅ What We've Accomplished

You now have a fully functional HTTPS server running your Labs API using the Rip server's built-in Certificate Authority (CA) system. This provides:

- **🔐 Proper SSL/TLS encryption** for all API communications
- **🛡️ Trusted certificates** in your macOS keychain (no browser warnings!)
- **⚡ CA-signed certificates** that work seamlessly with browsers
- **🌐 Local development HTTPS** that mirrors production setups

## 🚀 Your HTTPS Server is Running

**Labs API HTTPS Endpoint**: `https://localhost:3443`

### Available Endpoints:

- **Ping**: `https://localhost:3443/ping`
- **Hello**: `https://localhost:3443/hello?name=YourName`
- **Calculator**: `https://localhost:3443/calc?a=10&b=5&op=add`
- **Email Validation**: `https://localhost:3443/email?email=test@example.com`
- **User Mock**: `https://localhost:3443/user`
- **Phone Format**: `https://localhost:3443/format-phone?phone=1234567890`
- **Username Check**: `https://localhost:3443/username?username=developer123`
- **Age Check**: `https://localhost:3443/age-check?age=25`
- **Create User**: `POST https://localhost:3443/create-user` (with JSON body)

## 🔧 How It Works

### Certificate Authority Setup
```bash
# 1. Initialize the CA (already done)
bun server ca:init

# 2. Trust the CA in macOS keychain (already done)
bun server ca:trust

# 3. Start server with HTTPS
bun server apps/labs/api https:ca
```

### Server Status
```bash
# Check if server is running
bun server status

# Stop the server
bun server stop
```

## 🌐 Browser Access

1. **Open your browser** and navigate to `https://localhost:3443/ping`
2. **No security warnings** should appear (thanks to CA trust)
3. **Test the endpoints** using the provided HTML test page: `test-https.html`

## 📱 Testing with curl

```bash
# Test with certificate verification disabled (quick test)
curl -k https://localhost:3443/ping

# Test specific endpoints
curl -k "https://localhost:3443/hello?name=Developer"
curl -k "https://localhost:3443/calc?a=10&b=5&op=mul" | jq .
```

## 🔄 Restarting the Server

If you need to restart the server:

```bash
# Stop current server
bun server stop

# Start with HTTPS again
bun server apps/labs/api https:ca
```

## 🎯 Production Notes

This CA setup is perfect for local development. For production, you would:

1. **Use Let's Encrypt** or other trusted CA certificates
2. **Configure with your own certs**:
   ```bash
   bun server apps/labs/api prod cert.pem key.pem
   ```
3. **Use proper domain names** instead of localhost

## 🛠️ Advanced Configuration

### Both HTTP and HTTPS
```bash
bun server apps/labs/api http+https
# HTTP: http://localhost:3000
# HTTPS: https://localhost:3443
```

### Custom Ports
```bash
bun server apps/labs/api https:ca 8443
# HTTPS: https://localhost:8443
```

### Multiple Workers
```bash
bun server apps/labs/api https:ca w:5
# 5 worker processes for better performance
```

## 🔍 Certificate Details

- **CA Location**: `~/.rip-server/ca/`
- **Certificate Validity**: 2 years
- **Supported Domains**: localhost, *.localhost
- **Encryption**: RSA 3072-bit with SHA-256

## 🎉 Success!

Your Labs API is now running securely over HTTPS with proper CA-signed certificates. This setup provides:

- ✅ **Production-like HTTPS environment** for local development
- ✅ **No browser security warnings**
- ✅ **Encrypted API communications**
- ✅ **Hot reload support** (edit files and see changes instantly)
- ✅ **Multi-worker architecture** for performance

**Next Steps**: Open `https://localhost:3443` in your browser and start testing your API endpoints!
