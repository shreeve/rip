==[ Fixes] ==

1) We improved the formatting of commas, newlines, separators for array output

==[ Use native ?. instead of CS's generated output ]==

Possible speedups:

Are these identically the same or does CS's "?." operator do anything differently?

// ES6
const ranges = lexer.options?.ranges

// CS
ranges = (ref1 = lexer.options) != null ? ref1.ranges : void 0;

Performance: The ES6 optional chaining is slightly faster in modern engines because:

It's a native operator with optimized bytecode
No temporary variable assignment
No ternary expression evaluation
