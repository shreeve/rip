## BUMPS (MUMPS) grammar using Solar SLR(1)

This folder contains a CoffeeScript/Rip-based grammar (`bumps.coffee`) for the M (MUMPS) language, targeting the Solar SLR(1) parser generator (`packages/parser/solar.coffee`). The design mirrors how CoffeeScript‚Äôs own grammar is authored and compiled within this repo, but adapted to M‚Äôs syntax and whitespace/command rules.

### Current status

- Grammar file: `packages/parser/languages/bumps/bumps.coffee`
- Linter: 0 errors (as of latest edits)
- Major cleanups completed:
  - Normalized relational operators to named tokens: `GT`, `LT`, `GE`, `LE`, `EQ`, `NE`, `CONTAINS`, `NCONTAINS`, `FOLLOWS`, `NFOLLOWS`, `SORTAFTER`, `NSORTAFTER`.
  - Fixed typo `NFOLOWS` ‚Üí `NFOLLOWS` in both grammar and lexer.
  - Removed unused `LS` token and the `opt_ls` rule; simplified `opt_label` accordingly.
  - Restructured operator precedence to better reflect M semantics (see below).
  - Corrected lexer escaping and quoting around `'`, `?`, `]`, and `]]` to avoid parser/linter issues.

### Operator precedence (high ‚Üí low)

- Unary: `NOT`, `UPLUS`, `UMINUS`
- Exponent: `EXP` (`**` if supported)
- Multiplicative: `MUL`, `DIV`, `IDIV`, `MOD` (`*`, `/`, `\`, `#`)
- Additive: `PLUS`, `MINUS`
- String concat: `CONCAT` (`_`)
- Pattern: `PMATCH` (`?`)
- Relational (nonassoc): `GT`, `LT`, `GE`, `LE`, `EQ`, `NE`, `CONTAINS`, `NCONTAINS`, `FOLLOWS`, `NFOLLOWS`, `SORTAFTER`, `NSORTAFTER`
- Logical: `AND`, then `OR`

This layout reduces shift/reduce risk and matches how M‚Äôs expressions are typically evaluated.

### Lexer and parsing model

- The grammar includes a Jison-style lex spec (`exports.lex`) to document tokenization rules for M, including:
  - Command/expr modes (space-separated commands, dot-indentation, labels/tags)
  - Command abbreviations normalized into canonical tokens
  - Postconditions (`:`) and argument separators
  - Operators and patterns, with negations expressed as distinct tokens (e.g. `NFOLLOWS`)

Note: Solar currently focuses on generating the parser. It doesn‚Äôt compile `exports.lex` into a runtime lexer. At parse time, attach a lexer that implements `setInput` and `lex` (Jison-style). The included lex spec can be used as the source for such a lexer (e.g., via jison-lex or a lightweight adapter).

### Build (generate the parser)

Use Solar to generate a CommonJS parser module from the grammar:

```bash
coffee packages/parser/solar.coffee -g \
  -o packages/parser/languages/bumps/parser.js \
  packages/parser/languages/bumps/bumps.coffee
```

Add `-s` to print grammar stats, or `-c` to emit a Brotli-compressed build.

### Runtime wiring (how to parse)

At runtime the Solar-generated parser expects:

- A lexer with `setInput(input, yy)` and `lex()` that returns token names or ids, and sets `yytext`, `yyleng`, `yylineno`, `yylloc`.
- A `yy` object supplying any helpers/functions/classes referenced by grammar actions. For this grammar, `yy.node(type, props)` is sufficient (a trivial factory is provided via `moduleInclude` if not supplied).

Minimal adapter example (pseudocode):

```js
const parser = require('./parser.js');

class LexerAdapter { /* implement setInput, lex, showPosition */ }

parser.yy = { node: (type, props) => ({ type, ...props }) };
parser.lexer = new LexerAdapter();

const ok = parser.parse(source);
```

If you compile the Jison-style `exports.lex` into a lexer with jison-lex, bind its instance as `parser.lexer`.

### Runner

- Runner can optionally print debug info by setting `BUMPS_DEBUG=1`.

Examples:

```bash
# Print tokens and AST JSON for the default sample
BUMPS_DEBUG=1 node packages/parser/languages/bumps/run-bumps.cjs

# Or for a specific file
BUMPS_DEBUG=1 node packages/parser/languages/bumps/run-bumps.cjs path/to/file.b
```

When enabled, the runner prints the token stream (as `[tag, value]` pairs) and the parsed AST JSON. This is useful for verifying lexer output and grammar reductions while iterating.

### Performance and trade-offs

- Performance: LR parsing is linear in input size with small constant factors (table lookups). Solar emits compact tables and straight-line code; generation time is irrelevant at runtime.
- Maintainability: the grammar is declarative and readable; precedence/associativity are explicit. Evolution is mostly editing productions, not control flow.
- Pros vs hand-rolled: clearer spec, deterministic performance (no backtracking), easier refactors, and shared toolchain with CoffeeScript.
- Cons/notes: push context sensitivity (command position, abbreviations, dot-indentation, postconditions) into the lexer/rewriter; polish error messages; incremental/streaming parsing would require extra work.
- Net: fast enough and easy to work with. With context handled in the lexer/rewriter, the SLR(1) parser remains both performant and maintainable for M.

### Important consistency note (assignment token)

The grammar currently uses `EQUAL` for `set_item` (`lvalue EQUAL expr`), but the lexer returns `EQ` for `=`. Pick one of these approaches before generating the parser:

- Preferred: change the grammar to use `EQ` in `set_item`.
- Alternative: modify the lexer to emit `EQUAL` (only where appropriate) instead of `EQ`.

### Design choices that make SLR(1) work for M

- Move context-sensitive concerns into the lexer/rewriter: command position, abbreviations, space-separated command lists, dot indentation to `INDENT/OUTDENT` depth, and postconditions. Keep the grammar LR-friendly.
- Normalize negated relations and pattern matches into distinct tokens (`NE`, `NCONTAINS`, `NFOLLOWS`, `NSORTAFTER`, etc.) to avoid binding quirks around `'`.
- Keep commands and expressions separate, with a `CommandList` and per-command productions that accept optional postconditions and arguments.

### What‚Äôs next

- Align the `EQUAL` vs `EQ` token (see consistency note above).
- Expand command argument patterns (many are scaffolded: `SET`, `KILL`, `NEW`, `DO`, `WRITE`, `READ`).
- Decide on whether to generate a lexer from `exports.lex` (jison-lex) or maintain a hand-written adapter.
- Add a small `run-bumps.js` like the CoffeeScript `run-parse.js` if you‚Äôd like a one-command demo.

### Inception bonus

The BUMPS grammar is authored in CoffeeScript/Rip and compiled by Solar‚Äîthe same pipeline used to generate CoffeeScript‚Äôs own parser here‚Äîparsing a grammar that itself documents the lexer and parser for M. Layers on layers. üéØ

### Argumentless commands (standard M)
```

These have an argumentless form in the ANSI/X11/ISO sense (and in YottaDB/GT.M). I‚Äôm citing YottaDB because it documents the exact forms clearly:

BREAK ‚Äî may be used with no argument; when followed by another command on the same line, at least two spaces must follow BREAK.
YottaDB Documentation

DO ‚Äî has a no-argument form that transfers control to the next dot-indented line; also requires the two-spaces rule when followed by another command.
YottaDB Documentation

ELSE ‚Äî has no arguments by design (it‚Äôs just ELSE plus the rest-of-line scope). (Same page‚Äôs command list; ELSE is the no-args branch of IF.)
YottaDB Documentation

FOR ‚Äî the lvn=expr[:‚Ä¶] part is optional, so plain FOR is legal and controls the rest-of-line scope. Note: FOR is a conditional command and does not take a command postconditional.
YottaDB Documentation

HALT ‚Äî no argument (only an optional postconditional).
YottaDB Documentation

IF ‚Äî the truth-valued expression list is optional; IF alone tests $TEST. Note: IF is conditional and does not allow a command postconditional.
YottaDB Documentation

KILL ‚Äî the argument list is optional; KILL alone is valid (kills locals per implementation rules).
YottaDB Documentation

LOCK ‚Äî the argument list is optional; argumentless LOCK is valid (commonly used to release all locks). InterSystems docs state the ‚Äúrelease all locks‚Äù behavior explicitly.
YottaDB Documentation
InterSystems Documentation

NEW ‚Äî the variable list is optional; NEW alone is valid (new all locals per scope rules).
YottaDB Documentation

QUIT ‚Äî optional argument; QUIT alone is valid. (YottaDB notes ‚Äúcommands without arguments such as QUIT‚Ä¶‚Äù, InterSystems QUIT page shows both forms.)
YottaDB Documentation
InterSystems Documentation

TCOMMIT ‚Äî no argument.
YottaDB Documentation

TROLLBACK ‚Äî optional integer argument; argumentless form is valid.
YottaDB Documentation

TSTART ‚Äî arguments optional; argumentless form is valid.
YottaDB Documentation

Everything else in the base set requires arguments (e.g., CLOSE, GOTO, HANG, JOB, MERGE, OPEN, READ, SET, USE, VIEW, WRITE, XECUTE).
