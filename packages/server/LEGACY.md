# Rip Server Legacy Nuggets (Deprecated)

All actionable items from legacy have been captured in `packages/server/SPEC.md`.

Refer to SPEC.md for the current plan (HTTPSâ€‘only gateway, Host routing, TLS/dev certs, registry & redirects).

This file is intentionally left minimal and will be removed once SPEC is fully implemented.
