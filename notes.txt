Review the packages/rip-server/README.md file deeply and think about it's structure, the intended reader (a github developer who is evaluating if they should use rip-server for their project) and then read through the code in that directory and make whatever changes you think are necessary to the README.md file in that directory. If the document is already really solid, then don't make any changes. If it could be improved and still kept easy to read and understand and sufficiently informative, then make all needed changes.

- Nginx runs multiple worker processes, each doing nonblocking accept; it can enable reuseport and a large listen backlog to spread accepts evenly and avoid thundering herds.

- It terminates client connections and handles HTTP keepalive/timeouts; requests are buffered and queued inside nginx, not at the app.

- It proxies to an upstream pool (TCP or unix sockets), keeps per-upstream keepalive connection pools, and load-balances (round-robin by default, also least_conn, hash).

- It retries another upstream on certain failures (connect/read timeouts, 5xx, etc.) via proxy_next_upstream and caps attempts with proxy_next_upstream_tries, so transient backend failures rarely surface to clients.

- With the upstream queue directive, nginx can queue requests when all upstream connections are busy instead of immediately returning errors; if the queue times out, nginx returns an error (commonly 504).

- Typical errors:
  - 502/504: connect/read/write/timeout or exhausted retries
  - 503: generally when no upstreams are available/marked down or queue overflow

- Unicorn pairing: unicorn workers are single-inflight per process. Nginx connects to a shared unix socket exposed by the unicorn master; the kernel distributes accepts across forked workers. Many configs disable upstream keepalive to unicorn or keep it small; nginx still maintains client keepalive.

- Minimal nginx-style config example (RR across multiple Bun/unicorn workers over unix sockets, retries, queue, and client keepalive):
```nginx
worker_processes auto;
events { worker_connections 65535; }

http {
  upstream app {
    server unix:/run/app/app.1.sock max_fails=3 fail_timeout=5s;
    server unix:/run/app/app.2.sock max_fails=3 fail_timeout=5s;
    # ...
    keepalive 128;                # upstream connection pool
    queue 1024 timeout=5s;        # queue when all upstream conns are busy
  }

  server {
    listen 8080 reuseport backlog=16384;
    keepalive_requests 100000;
    keepalive_timeout 5s;

    location / {
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Connection "";
      proxy_next_upstream error timeout invalid_header http_500 http_502 http_503 http_504;
      proxy_next_upstream_tries 3;
      proxy_connect_timeout 1s;
      proxy_read_timeout 5s;
      proxy_pass http://app;
    }
  }
}
```

- To mimic nginx+unicorn semantics in your Bun LB:
  - Keep workers single-inflight (as you do).
  - Add an LB-side queue with a timeout and retry the next worker on connection error or 5xx; only return 5xx when the queue times out or retries are exhausted.
  - Maintain per-worker socket pools and health (quarantine on failures), with short connect/read timeouts.

ONE-SHOT: Implement server2 per attached docs/server2.md

Goal:
- Build a clean-room Bun-based HTTP LB + worker manager for Rip apps, per docs/server2.md.
- Put all code in packages/server2.
- Add root script: "server2": "bun packages/server2/rip-server.ts".
- Must run with: bun server2 <app-path> [flags]

Key requirements (from server2.md):
- Sockets
  - Per-worker data-plane sockets: /tmp/rip_<variant>_<app>.<id>.sock
  - Control plane Unix socket (LB-owned): /tmp/rip_<variant>_<app>.ctl.sock

- Registration/lifecycle (worker self-registers)
  - Worker registers only after it is actually ready:
    { op: "register", app, workerId, pid, socket, version? } → { ok: true }
  - Worker deregisters on clean shutdown:
    { op: "deregister", app, workerId } → { ok: true }
  - LB builds in-memory pool from these messages; no per-request directory scanning.

- Worker (single-inflight; Bun.serve on per-worker socket)
  - On each request (module mode), resolve handler via packages/api reloader:
    const handler = await createReloader({entryPath}).getHandler()
  - Atomic swap; no 404s; keep old handler until new is ready.
  - HTTP: keepalive; idleTimeout ≈ 5–10s; maxRequestBodySize 100MB.
  - Graceful exit on SIGTERM/SIGINT or after maxRequests.

- Load Balancer (Bun.serve TCP)
  - Pool routing from registrations; round-robin; skip inflight>0.
  - Single-inflight map: socket → 0|1.
  - Keepalive to workers.
  - Queue/backpressure: bounded FIFO with max_size, timeout_ms; 503 when full; 504 on queue timeout.
  - Failures: on connect/read error, drop socket from pool immediately (no default quarantine).
  - Retry budget: at most one retry per request (busy/connect).
  - Endpoints:
    - GET /status → { status: "healthy|degraded", app, workers, ports, uptime }
  - Health: healthy once ≥1 worker is registered.
  - Strip internal headers on egress: Rip-Worker-Busy, Rip-Worker-Id.
  - Logging: access log ON by default (human), --json-logging optional.

- Manager
  - Spawns N workers; sets env (WORKER_ID, APP_NAME, SOCKET_PATH, RIP_VARIANT); cleans per-worker sockets.
  - Monitors exits; restarts with backoff; no registration (workers self-register).
  - Admin rolling restarts (no watchers, no socket-touching):
    bun server2 restart <app>
    Sequence per worker: wait drain (single-inflight) → terminate → spawn → worker self-registers.

- Module reloads (API layer)
  - Handled entirely in packages/api reloader with cache-busted imports (?v=<mtime>) and reset of API globals; atomic handler swap; no 404s.
  - Deep graph changes may require process reloads.

- CLI & Flags
  - bun server2 <app-path> [flags]
  - Workers: w:<N|auto>; maxRequests: r:<N>
  - Ports/protocol: http<:port>, https<:port> (defaults to 3080 and 3443, with smart default increments if busy)
  - Logging: --json-logging, --no-access-log
  - Variant/sockets: --variant=<name>, --socket-prefix=<prefix>
  - LB tuning: --max-queue, --queue-timeout-ms, --connect-timeout-ms, --read-timeout-ms
  - Hot reload: --hot-reload=<none|process|module> (dev default module; prod default none or process)

- Files to create (packages/server2)
  - utils.ts (copy needed helpers: scale, timestamp/log formatting, header stripping, queue helpers, timeout/abort, flag/env parsing)
  - worker.ts
  - server.ts
  - manager.ts
  - rip-server.ts (CLI)

Constraints:
- Bun-only runtime; do not modify packages/server/*.
- Use existing .rip plugin behavior (supports query cache-busters).
- No filesystem watchers; no per-request directory scans.
- No default quarantine; optional future note only.

Acceptance:
- Compiles and lints.
- Root package.json includes: "server2": "bun packages/server2/rip-server.ts".
- Smoke: curl -sf http://localhost:PORT/status
- Load: wrk -t8 -c512 -d15s --latency http://127.0.0.1:PORT/ping
- Behaviors: single-inflight per worker; pool-based routing; bounded queue; drop-on-first-failure; admin rolling restart; module reloads have no 404 window.

Deliverables:
- All new files under packages/server2.
- Minimal, documented code; fast path tight; logs per spec.

Please scan the packages/server2 code again... I want to see if we can do as MUCH WORK UP FRONT as possible before we start testing this sucker. We basically want a server that uses unix sockets to dispatch to workers that are managed by a manager who spawns and reaps workers as instructed and then allows the workers to join or quit the server as needed. We want this approach to be highly efficient and CLEAN. We want to support BOTH module level hot reloads as well as process level hot reloads or no reloads at all (all three modes should be supported). I want to be able to fire up 'wrk' and benchmark this and see more than 10,000 RPS (maybe upwards of 20,000 RPS) for a simple /ping type of endpoint. I want to be able to update a file and have the hot module reload immediately detect this and never provide a stale response and never kill an inflight response (unless it's hanging) and allow workers to drain gracefully while seamlessly firing up new workers to handle the requests. I assume that we will likely need a queue on the server side to handle thundering herds or to be able to queue as needed if a reload is taking place. In all, we want things to be simple, clean, and performant. As you look at the code in packages/server2 do you think it will meet these expectations???

==

You also mentioned these three options:

• Minimal LB retry on 503(busy) with tiny jitter (keeps shared socket; big drop in non-2xx).
• Tiny worker-side serialize (queue length 1) instead of 503.
• Reintroduce per-worker sockets + ready-set in the LB for precise idle-only dispatch.

How hard would a tiny worker-side serialize with a configurable queue length (can we try 1, then 2, then 3???) and benchmark those?

We basically want a server that uses one unix socket per worker, whose lifecycle is managed by a manager who spawns and reaps workers as instructed and then allows the workers to join or quit the server as needed, using a control panel that they access on the server.

Should we implement a 'restart' command like 'stop' for the server that basically does a stop first and then runs? so we don't have to call it twice???
